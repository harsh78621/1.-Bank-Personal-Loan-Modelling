# 1.-Bank-Personal-Loan-Modelling
Data Description:

The file  contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.

Context:

This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.

Outcomes:

Exploratory Data Analysis

Preparing the data to train a model

Training and making predictions using a classification model

Model evaluation

Steps and tasks:

Read the column description and ensure you understand each attribute well

Study the data distribution in each attribute, share your findings

Get the target column distribution.

Split the data into training and test set in the ratio of 70:30 respectively

Use different classification models (Logistic, K-NN and Na√Øve Bayes) to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans

Print the confusion matrix for all the above models

Give reasoning on which is the best model in this case and why it performs better?
